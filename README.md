# CrashReporter for Qt Apps 
After getting frustated to get crash reporter (or with proper license). I decided to create one. This is result.

Under dev. Not ready yet. Soon it will be. Stay tuned.

## Components
* **breakpad** - Google breakpad library ( BSD 3 license)
* **CrashReporter** - It will support features like send report,create github issue. 
* **CrashHandler** - Need to add inside Qt App. It will create crash report and trigger crash reporter.

#Working
* Crash reporter features like send report, create issue.
 

## TODO
* Examples
* Handler
* Add screenshots
* Any WIKI page about how easy to use breakpad with Qt.

# License
* Apache 2.0 license
