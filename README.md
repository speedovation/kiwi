Welcome to KiWi! 
-------------------
KineticWing (dubbed KiWi) is a free modern PHP editor which was created with the idea in mind that the PHP community needs a lightweight, portable and a smart development environment for fast web development.

What makes KiWi different from other web code editors?

* **You should not wait for your IDE to load**. Tired of seeing the long loading screens? KiWi is one editor which loads as soon as you double click its icon!
* **The IDE should not reduce you work space**. A clutterless environment is what every developer deserves and this is exactly what you will get in KiWi. The toolbars are designed in such a way that they don't get in your way of creating the next big thing!
* **The IDE shouldn't limit what I can do**. With third party plugin support, what you can achieve is limitless! We even provide our own plugins so that you can start out of the box!

After many years of building our IDE, we are at a stage where we can provide our next generation developers with a stable product. Pretty soon we will be floating out the beta version of our product which is currently at version 2.0.6. Feedback is very important and hence we will need all the feedback we can get. As soon as the beta is relaeased, please use it and tell us what you think! We will be waiting on you! :)

How to install and run KiWi!
-------------------------------

#### Download

We have downloadables for Windows, Linux and Mac. Right now the downloads are invitations only. You can find a form for invite and download links for older versions [here](http://www.kineticwing.com/download).

#### Usage

Most of KiWi should be self explanatory but when you open it, you can start by _File > New > Type..._ .

Hit F6 to see the welcome screen. There you can view the open sessions, projects and files. The Feedback button is right there in the corner!

#### Need help?

To help our first time users, we will soon have a Wiki page. Please hang tight while we create content for it!

Helping KiWi
----------------

####Where do I report the bug I found?

We have a [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/codeyash/flavours/issues) (Anonymous allowed) and [Github](https://github.com/speedovation/kiwi/issues) accounts and you can use either one to raise bugs!

####What about suggestions?

You can use the either above accounts and the feedback feature on KiWi to do the same.

####OK! I am a hotshot developer and want to contribute to the development of KiWi!

Yes you can help us! We are trying to build a community and you can certainly create plugins for everyone to use! Although we are in dire need of Qt developers, we just can't hire right now because we are very small and having limited budget. So keep on the lookout for when we can!

####You need money?

Of course! We are looking for investors who can help us build our product for the next generation of PHP developers. If you are one then please contact us from [here](http://www.kineticwing.com/contact). Even if you are not an investor yourself but know someone who can help, then please point us in that direction!

I want to track KiWi's growth!
